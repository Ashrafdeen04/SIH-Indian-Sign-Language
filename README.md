# Indian Sign Language (ISL) to Text/Voice Bidirectional Translation

## Overview
This project presents a real-time bidirectional translation system for Indian Sign Language (ISL). The system utilizes machine learning to recognize hand gestures from live video and translate them into text or voice, and vice-versa. This technology can serve as a valuable communication aid, bridging the gap between the deaf and hearing communities.

## Key Features
* **Bidirectional Translation:** Translates ISL to text/voice and also converts text/voice back into ISL gestures.
* **Real-time Processing:** Uses OpenCV for real-time video stream processing.
* **Accurate Hand Tracking:** Leverages Mediapipe to accurately track and interpret hand movements.
* **User-friendly Interface:** Provides a simple interface for easy interaction.

## Tech Stack
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow
* **Libraries:** Mediapipe, OpenCV
